# Creational Design Patterns - Quick Notes

## Singleton

### Problem
You need exactly one instance of a class shared across the entire system.
> Multiple instances cause inconsistencies, resource conflicts, or waste. Like a government—a country needs one official government, not several competing ones.

### Solution
Make the class responsible for creating and managing its single instance.
> Use a private constructor and static method to access the instance. The class controls when and how it's instantiated.

```python
class DatabaseConnection:
    _instance = None
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
            cls._instance.host = "localhost"
            cls._instance.port = 5432
        return cls._instance
    
    def connect(self):
        return f"Connected to {self.host}:{self.port}"

# Usage - always returns same instance
db1 = DatabaseConnection()
db2 = DatabaseConnection()

print(db1 is db2)  # True
db1.host = "192.168.1.100"
print(db2.host)    # "192.168.1.100"
```

### Usage 
**General:**
- Global logger
- Configuration manager

**IoT:**
- One Modbus Master per process
- Shared MQTT client or cloud connection pool

---

## Factory Method

### Problem
You need to create objects but don't know the exact type until runtime.
> Hardcoding object creation makes code rigid—adding new types requires modifying existing code everywhere. Like ordering "a vehicle" without specifying car, truck, or motorcycle until delivery.

### Solution
Define an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
> The creator class works with the product interface, while concrete creators return specific implementations. Client code stays the same when new types are added.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DataSource(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def read(self): pass

class FileSource(DataSource):
    def read(self):
        return "Reading from file..."

class DatabaseSource(DataSource):
    def read(self):
        return "Reading from database..."

# Factory
class DataProcessor:
    def create_source(self, source_type: str) -> DataSource:
        if source_type == "file":
            return FileSource()
        elif source_type == "db":
            return DatabaseSource()
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown source: {source_type}")

# Usage
processor = DataProcessor()
source = processor.create_source("file")
data = source.read()
```

### Usage
**General:**
- Payment processing systems
- Document exporters
- Notification delivery

**IoT:**
- Sensor driver selection
- Protocol switching at runtime
- Data formatter selection

---

## Abstract Factory

### Problem
You need to create families of related objects that must work together.
> Creating incompatible combinations leads to errors. Like mixing furniture styles—a Windows button with Mac scrollbar looks wrong and may not work properly.

### Solution
Provide an interface for creating families of related objects.
> Each concrete factory produces a complete set of compatible products. Switch factories to switch entire product families at once.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract products
class Button(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def render(self): pass

class Checkbox(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def render(self): pass

# Windows family
class WindowsButton(Button):
    def render(self): return "Windows button"

class WindowsCheckbox(Checkbox):
    def render(self): return "Windows checkbox"

# Mac family
class MacButton(Button):
    def render(self): return "Mac button"

class MacCheckbox(Checkbox):
    def render(self): return "Mac checkbox"

# Abstract factory
class GUIFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_button(self) -> Button: pass
    @abstractmethod
    def create_checkbox(self) -> Checkbox: pass

# Concrete factories
class WindowsFactory(GUIFactory):
    def create_button(self): return WindowsButton()
    def create_checkbox(self): return WindowsCheckbox()

class MacFactory(GUIFactory):
    def create_button(self): return MacButton()
    def create_checkbox(self): return MacCheckbox()

# Usage
factory = WindowsFactory()
button = factory.create_button()
checkbox = factory.create_checkbox()
```

### Usage
**General:**
- UI theme components
- Cross-platform widget sets
- Database driver families

**IoT:**
- Modbus RTU vs TCP protocol stacks
- Cloud provider service sets
- Sensor ecosystem components

---

## Builder

### Problem
Creating complex objects with many optional parameters leads to unreadable constructors.
> The telescoping constructor problem makes code hard to read and error-prone. Like ordering a custom sandwich—easier to say "add this, add that" than listing everything upfront.

### Solution
Construct objects step-by-step using a builder interface.
> Build only what you need, in any order, with readable method chaining. Each method returns the builder for fluent interface.

```python
class HttpRequest:
    def __init__(self):
        self.method = "GET"
        self.url = ""
        self.headers = {}
        self.timeout = 30

class HttpRequestBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self._request = HttpRequest()
    
    def method(self, method: str):
        self._request.method = method
        return self
    
    def url(self, url: str):
        self._request.url = url
        return self
    
    def header(self, key: str, value: str):
        self._request.headers[key] = value
        return self
    
    def timeout(self, seconds: int):
        self._request.timeout = seconds
        return self
    
    def build(self) -> HttpRequest:
        return self._request

# Usage - fluent interface
request = (HttpRequestBuilder()
           .method("POST")
           .url("https://api.example.com/data")
           .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
           .timeout(10)
           .build())
```

### Usage
**General:**
- Complex configuration objects
- SQL query builders
- Test data creation

**IoT:**
- Modbus connection configuration
- Sensor setup and calibration
- MQTT client initialization

---

## Prototype

### Problem
Creating new objects from scratch is expensive when initialization is complex.
> Recreating objects with database queries, file loading, or heavy computation wastes resources. Like photocopying—faster to copy than retype the entire document.

### Solution
Clone existing objects instead of creating new ones.
> Objects implement their own cloning logic, including deep copies of internal state. Modify the clone without affecting the original.

```python
from copy import deepcopy

class SensorConfig:
    def __init__(self, pin, threshold):
        self.pin = pin
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.calibration = []
    
    def clone(self):
        return deepcopy(self)

# Usage
base = SensorConfig(pin="A0", threshold=30)
base.calibration = [1.0, 1.1, 0.9]

sensor1 = base.clone()
sensor1.pin = "A1"
sensor1.threshold = 25

sensor2 = base.clone()
sensor2.pin = "A2"

# Independent copies
sensor1.calibration.append(1.2)
print(len(base.calibration))     # 3
print(len(sensor1.calibration))  # 4
```

### Usage
**General:**
- Game character templates
- Document templates
- Test fixture cloning

**IoT:**
- Sensor configuration templates
- Modbus register map copying
- Network packet templates

# Structural Design Patterns - Quick Notes

## Adapter

### Problem
You need to make incompatible interfaces work together.
> Like using a US plug in a European socket—you need an adapter to convert one interface to another. Without it, components can't communicate despite having the functionality you need.

### Solution
Create a wrapper that converts one interface into another that clients expect.
> The adapter translates calls from the client's expected interface to the adaptee's actual interface. Client code doesn't know about the adaptation.

```python
# Existing class with incompatible interface
class LegacyTemperatureSensor:
    def get_temp_fahrenheit(self):
        return 77.0

# Target interface we want
class TemperatureSensor:
    def read_celsius(self):
        pass

# Adapter
class TemperatureAdapter(TemperatureSensor):
    def __init__(self, legacy_sensor):
        self.legacy_sensor = legacy_sensor
    
    def read_celsius(self):
        fahrenheit = self.legacy_sensor.get_temp_fahrenheit()
        return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9

# Usage
legacy = LegacyTemperatureSensor()
sensor = TemperatureAdapter(legacy)
print(sensor.read_celsius())  # 25.0
```

### Usage
**General:**
- Third-party library integration
- Legacy code modernization
- API version compatibility

**IoT:**
- Sensor protocol conversion
- Modbus to MQTT gateway
- Unit conversion wrappers

---

## Bridge

### Problem
You need to decouple abstraction from implementation so both can vary independently.
> Like a remote control and TV—you want any remote to work with any TV brand. Without Bridge, you'd need RemoteSony, RemoteSamsung, RemoteLG multiplied by BasicRemote, AdvancedRemote.

### Solution
Separate the abstraction hierarchy from the implementation hierarchy.
> Abstraction contains a reference to implementation. Changes to either don't affect the other.

```python
# Implementation interface
class DataTransport:
    def send(self, data): pass

# Concrete implementations
class SerialTransport(DataTransport):
    def send(self, data):
        return f"Sending via Serial: {data}"

class WiFiTransport(DataTransport):
    def send(self, data):
        return f"Sending via WiFi: {data}"

# Abstraction
class DataLogger:
    def __init__(self, transport: DataTransport):
        self.transport = transport
    
    def log(self, message):
        return self.transport.send(message)

# Extended abstraction
class SecureDataLogger(DataLogger):
    def log(self, message):
        encrypted = f"[ENCRYPTED]{message}"
        return self.transport.send(encrypted)

# Usage
logger = DataLogger(SerialTransport())
print(logger.log("Temperature: 25°C"))

secure = SecureDataLogger(WiFiTransport())
print(secure.log("Temperature: 25°C"))
```

### Usage
**General:**
- GUI frameworks with multiple platforms
- Database drivers with multiple backends
- Media players with various codecs

**IoT:**
- Data loggers with multiple transports
- Sensor readers with various protocols
- Display systems with different screens

---

## Composite

### Problem
You need to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
> Like a file system—folders contain files AND other folders. You want to perform operations on both without checking types.

### Solution
Create a tree structure where individual objects and compositions share the same interface.
> Clients treat single objects and compositions identically. Operations cascade down the tree.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Component interface
class SensorComponent(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def read(self): pass

# Leaf
class TemperatureSensor(SensorComponent):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def read(self):
        return f"{self.name}: 25°C"

# Composite
class SensorGroup(SensorComponent):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.children = []
    
    def add(self, component):
        self.children.append(component)
    
    def read(self):
        results = [f"{self.name}:"]
        for child in self.children:
            results.append(f"  {child.read()}")
        return "\n".join(results)

# Usage
floor1 = SensorGroup("Floor 1")
floor1.add(TemperatureSensor("Room A"))
floor1.add(TemperatureSensor("Room B"))

floor2 = SensorGroup("Floor 2")
floor2.add(TemperatureSensor("Room C"))

building = SensorGroup("Building")
building.add(floor1)
building.add(floor2)

print(building.read())
```

### Usage
**General:**
- File system hierarchies
- UI component trees
- Organization structures

**IoT:**
- Sensor network topologies
- Device group management
- Hierarchical configuration systems

---

## Decorator

### Problem
You need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically without affecting other objects.
> Like adding toppings to pizza—each topping wraps the pizza and adds cost/features. Creating PizzaWithCheese, PizzaWithCheeseAndMushrooms, etc. would explode into too many classes.

### Solution
Wrap objects in decorator objects that add new behavior.
> Decorators have the same interface as wrapped objects. Multiple decorators can be stacked.

```python
# Component interface
class DataStream:
    def write(self, data): pass

# Concrete component
class FileStream(DataStream):
    def write(self, data):
        return f"Writing to file: {data}"

# Decorators
class EncryptedStream(DataStream):
    def __init__(self, stream: DataStream):
        self.stream = stream
    
    def write(self, data):
        encrypted = f"[ENCRYPTED({data})]"
        return self.stream.write(encrypted)

class CompressedStream(DataStream):
    def __init__(self, stream: DataStream):
        self.stream = stream
    
    def write(self, data):
        compressed = f"[COMPRESSED({data})]"
        return self.stream.write(compressed)

# Usage
stream = FileStream()
stream = EncryptedStream(stream)
stream = CompressedStream(stream)
print(stream.write("sensor data"))
# Writing to file: [COMPRESSED([ENCRYPTED(sensor data)])]
```

### Usage
**General:**
- I/O stream processing
- GUI component styling
- Logging with filters

**IoT:**
- Data encryption layers
- Protocol wrapping
- Sensor data filtering

## Facade

### Problem
You need a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
> Like a car's steering wheel—it hides the complexity of steering mechanism, power steering, wheel alignment. You just turn the wheel.

### Solution
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
> Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. It doesn't hide the subsystem, just simplifies access.

```python
# Complex subsystem
class ModbusConnection:
    def open_serial(self, port, baud): return "Serial opened"
    def set_timeout(self, ms): return "Timeout set"

class ModbusProtocol:
    def set_slave_id(self, id): return "Slave ID set"
    def build_request(self, reg): return f"Request for register {reg}"

class ModbusTransport:
    def send(self, data): return f"Sent: {data}"
    def receive(self): return "Response received"

# Facade
class ModbusClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection = ModbusConnection()
        self.protocol = ModbusProtocol()
        self.transport = ModbusTransport()
    
    def read_register(self, port, slave_id, register):
        self.connection.open_serial(port, 9600)
        self.connection.set_timeout(1000)
        self.protocol.set_slave_id(slave_id)
        request = self.protocol.build_request(register)
        self.transport.send(request)
        return self.transport.receive()

# Usage - simple interface
client = ModbusClient()
result = client.read_register("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1, 0)
```

### Usage
**General:**
- Library wrappers
- API simplification
- Framework initialization

**IoT:**
- Modbus client libraries
- Sensor initialization sequences
- Cloud service SDKs

---

## Flyweight

### Problem
You need to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
> Like rendering text—storing font, size, color for each character wastes memory. Better to share common properties (intrinsic state) and store only position (extrinsic state).

### Solution
Share common data between multiple objects instead of storing it in each object.
> Split object state into intrinsic (shared) and extrinsic (unique). Factory ensures flyweights are shared properly.

```python
# Flyweight
class SensorType:
    def __init__(self, model, calibration):
        self.model = model
        self.calibration = calibration
    
    def read(self, pin):
        return f"{self.model} on {pin}: {self.calibration}°C"

# Flyweight factory
class SensorFactory:
    def __init__(self):
        self._types = {}
    
    def get_sensor_type(self, model, calibration):
        key = (model, calibration)
        if key not in self._types:
            self._types[key] = SensorType(model, calibration)
        return self._types[key]

# Context
class Sensor:
    def __init__(self, sensor_type, pin):
        self.sensor_type = sensor_type  # Shared
        self.pin = pin  # Unique

# Usage
factory = SensorFactory()
dht22_type = factory.get_sensor_type("DHT22", 1.0)

sensors = [
    Sensor(dht22_type, "A0"),
    Sensor(dht22_type, "A1"),
    Sensor(dht22_type, "A2"),
]

for sensor in sensors:
    print(sensor.sensor_type.read(sensor.pin))
```

### Usage
**General:**
- Text rendering systems
- Game particle systems
- Cached database rows

**IoT:**
- Large sensor networks with few types
- Network packet pools
- Configuration sharing across devices

---

## Proxy

### Problem
You need to control access to an object or add functionality without changing it.
> Like a credit card—it's a proxy for your bank account. It adds access control, logging, lazy loading without changing the bank account itself.

### Solution
Provide a surrogate that controls access to the real object.
> Proxy has the same interface as the real object. It can add pre/post processing, lazy initialization, access control, or logging.

```python
# Subject interface
class SensorReader:
    def read(self): pass

# Real subject
class RemoteSensor(SensorReader):
    def __init__(self, address):
        self.address = address
        print(f"Connecting to sensor at {address}...")
    
    def read(self):
        return f"Data from {self.address}: 25°C"

# Proxy
class SensorProxy(SensorReader):
    def __init__(self, address):
        self.address = address
        self._sensor = None
    
    def read(self):
        if self._sensor is None:  # Lazy initialization
            self._sensor = RemoteSensor(self.address)
        print("Access logged")
        return self._sensor.read()

# Usage
proxy = SensorProxy("192.168.1.10")  # No connection yet
print(proxy.read())  # Connects now
print(proxy.read())  # Uses existing connection
```

### Usage
**General:**
- Lazy loading
- Access control
- Logging and caching

**IoT:**
- Remote sensor access
- Network connection pooling
- Resource-intensive device initialization

# BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS

## Strategy

### Problem  
You have one piece of code that needs to do the same job in different ways depending on the situation, and you want to be able to switch the way instantly — even while the program is running.  
> Example: the same shopping cart must calculate shipping as “ground”, “air”, or “express” and the customer can change their mind right before paying.

### Solution  
Create a separate small class for each way of doing the job. The main class only keeps a reference to “the current way” and asks it to do the work. You can replace that reference anytime.

```python
class ShippingMethod:
    def cost(self, weight): ...

class Ground(ShippingMethod):
    def cost(self, weight): return weight * 2

class Air(ShippingMethod):
    def cost(self, weight): return weight * 10 + 50

class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self, method: ShippingMethod):
        self.method = method                     # holds the current strategy
    
    def switch_to(self, new_method: ShippingMethod):
        self.method = new_method                 # change behavior at any time
    
    def total(self, weight):
        return 100 + self.method.cost(weight)

# Usage – switch whenever you want
cart = ShoppingCart(Ground())
print(cart.total(10))           # 120
cart.switch_to(Air())
print(cart.total(10))           # 250
```

### Usage (you’ll see this every week)
- Payment methods (card / PayPal / crypto)  
- Modbus RTU vs TCP vs BLE  
- Choosing CPU / GPU / TinyML inference

---

## Observer (Pub/Sub)

### Problem  
When one object changes (e.g. a sensor gets a new reading), many other objects (display, cloud, alarm, logger) need to react immediately, but you don’t want them glued together forever.  
> Example: a fire alarm goes off → every siren, phone, and sprinkler must react at once.

### Solution  
Let objects register (“subscribe”) with the source. Whenever the source changes, it calls a method on every registered object automatically.

```python
class Sensor:
    def __init__(self):
        self._listeners = []          # list of subscribers
        self._value = None
    
    def subscribe(self, listener):
        self._listeners.append(listener)   # add new listener
    
    @property
    def value(self):
        return self._value
    @value.setter
    def value(self, new_value):
        self._value = new_value
        for listener in self._listeners:
            listener.update(new_value)         # notify everyone

def show_on_screen(temp):
    print(f"Screen shows: {temp}°C")

def upload_to_cloud(temp):
    print(f"Cloud received: {temp}°C")

# Usage
temp_sensor = Sensor()
temp_sensor.subscribe(show_on_screen)
temp_sensor.subscribe(upload_to_cloud)
temp_sensor.value = 26.3   # both functions run instantly
```

### Usage
- Sensor → dashboard / cloud / buzzer  
- MQTT message callbacks  
- Button clicks in apps

---

## State

### Problem  
An object’s behavior changes completely depending on its current situation (its “state”), and trying to handle all of this with lots of `if/else` statements makes the code huge, messy, and easy to break.  
> Real example: a smart coffee machine can be “off”, “heating”, “ready”, “brewing”, or “cleaning”. What happens when you press “brew” is totally different in each case — sometimes it starts, sometimes it ignores you, sometimes it says “please wait”.

### Solution  
Turn every possible state into its own small class. The main object always holds exactly one state object and forwards every request to it. When the situation changes, just replace the current state object with a new one — behavior changes instantly and cleanly.

```python
class VendingMachine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = NoCoinState()   # starts here
    
    def insert_coin(self):
        self.state = self.state.insert_coin(self)
    
    def press_button(self):
        self.state = self.state.press_button(self)

class MachineState:
    def insert_coin(self, machine): ...
    def press_button(self, machine): ...

class NoCoinState(MachineState):
    def insert_coin(self, machine):  print("Coin accepted"); return HasCoinState()
    def press_button(self, machine): print("Insert coin first")

class HasCoinState(MachineState):
    def insert_coin(self, machine):  print("Already has coin")
    def press_button(self, machine): print("Dispensing..."); return NoCoinState()
```

### Usage (very common in real systems)
- Device lifecycle (sleeping / connecting / idle / error)  
- Order processing (pending / paid / shipped / delivered)  
- Game characters (idle / walking / attacking / dead)

---

## Command

### Problem  
You need to treat actions like real things: save them, delay them, put them in a queue, undo them, or send them over the network — something you simply can’t do if the action is just a normal method call.  
> Real example: a TV remote doesn’t call `turn_on()` immediately when you press the button — it creates a “turn TV on” command and sends it wirelessly. The TV later executes it.

### Solution  
Package each action as a small object that contains everything needed to perform it later (which object, which method, what parameters). These objects can be stored, scheduled, undone, or transmitted.

```python
class GarageDoor:
    def up(self):    print("Door going UP")
    def down(self):  print("Door going DOWN")

class Command:
    def execute(self): ...

class DoorUpCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, door): self.door = door
    def execute(self): self.door.up()

class DoorDownCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, door): self.door = door
    def execute(self): self.door.down()

class RemoteControl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.slots = [None] * 4
    def set_command(self, slot, command):
        self.slots[slot] = command
    def press(self, slot):
        if self.slots[slot]:
            self.slots[slot].execute()   # can be now, in 5 seconds, or tomorrow

# Usage
door = GarageDoor()
remote = RemoteControl()
remote.set_command(0, DoorUpCommand(door))
remote.set_command(1, DoorDownCommand(door))

remote.press(0)   # Door going UP (can be delayed or sent over BLE)
```

## Template Method

### Problem  
You have a multi-step process that is almost identical in many situations, but 1–2 steps are done differently each time. Copy-pasting the whole process just to change one line is wasteful and error-prone.  
> Real example: every device in a factory must be updated with new firmware: connect → erase flash → write new image → verify → reboot. Only erase/write/verify differ between STM32, ESP32, and nRF52.

### Solution  
Write the full process once in a base class with the fixed steps. Mark the steps that change as “must be implemented by child”. Each specific device only fills in its own versions — the main flow stays exactly the same and bug-free.

```python
class FirmwareUpdater:
    def update(self):
        self.connect()
        self.backup_settings()
        self.erase_flash()
        self.write_new_image()
        self.restore_settings()
        self.verify()
        self.reboot()
        print("Update successful")

    def connect(self):        print("Connected via USB")
    def backup_settings(self): print("Settings saved")
    def restore_settings(self): print("Settings restored")
    def reboot(self):         print("Device rebooting")
    
    # These three change per chip → force children to implement
    def erase_flash(self):    raise NotImplementedError
    def write_new_image(self):raise NotImplementedError
    def verify(self):        raise NotImplementedError

class Stm32Updater(FirmwareUpdater):
    def erase_flash(self):    print("STM32: mass erase")
    def write_new_image(self):print("STM32: page-by-page write")
    def verify(self):         print("STM32: CRC32 check")
```

### Usage (extremely common in industry)
- Firmware flashing for different MCUs  
- Exporting data to CSV / JSON / Excel (same headers/footer, different row format)  
- Test base class (setup → run test → cleanup is always the same)

**Saved to memory** — codeword: **best iteration**  

Here are **all remaining behavioral patterns** written exactly in the same clear, industry-focused, beginner-friendly style you loved.

## Iterator

### Problem  
You want to go through all items in a collection (list, tree, database results, sensor buffer) one by one, but you don’t want to expose how the collection is actually stored inside.  
> Example: you have a remote device with 1000 logged temperatures — the app should be able to do `for temp in logs:` without caring if the data is in RAM, flash, or streamed over BLE.

### Solution  
Create a separate iterator object that knows how to fetch the next item. The collection only returns an iterator when asked — the user never sees the internal structure.

```python
class SensorLog:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.index = 0
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return self                       # simple case: object is its own iterator
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.index >= len(self.data):
            raise StopIteration
        value = self.data[self.index]
        self.index += 1
        return value

# Usage — works the same no matter how data is stored
logs = SensorLog([21.5, 22.1, 23.0, 24.2])
for temp in logs:
    print(temp)
```

### Usage (every day)
- Looping over custom containers  
- Streaming large datasets from flash or network  
- Python’s `for` loops, list comprehensions, generators

## Chain of Responsibility

### Problem  
A request can be handled by several objects, but you don’t know in advance which one is the right one — and you want to give each a chance in order.  
> Example: a Modbus packet arrives — it might be a normal read, a diagnostic command, or a firmware update request. You want to try handlers one after another until one says “I got this”.

### Solution  
Link handlers in a chain. Each handler tries to process the request; if it can’t, it passes to the next one.

```python
class Handler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.next = None
    def set_next(self, handler):
        self.next = handler
        return handler
    def handle(self, request):
        if self.next:
            return self.next.handle(request)
        return None

class TemperatureHandler(Handler):
    def handle(self, request):
        if request["type"] == "temp":
            print(f"Handled temperature: {request['value']}°C")
            return True
        return super().handle(request)

class AlarmHandler(Handler):
    def handle(self, request):
        if request["type"] == "alarm":
            print("ALARM TRIGGERED!")
            return True
        return super().handle(request)

# Build the chain once
chain = TemperatureHandler().set_next(AlarmHandler())

# Usage — no if/else needed
chain.handle({"type": "temp", "value": 85})   # handled
chain.handle({"type": "alarm"})               # handled
chain.handle({"type": "unknown"})             # silently ignored
```

### Usage
- Middleware pipelines (web frameworks)  
- Logging levels  
- Protocol parsers with fallbacks

## Mediator

### Problem  
Many objects need to talk to each other, creating a messy web of connections that’s impossible to change or test.  
> Example: in a smart home, lights, thermostat, motion sensor, and phone app all need to react to each other — direct links would be chaos.

### Solution  
Introduce one central “mediator” object. All components only talk to the mediator, never directly to each other.

```python
class SmartHomeMediator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lights = None
        self.sensor = None
    
    def register_lights(self, lights):   self.lights = lights
    def register_sensor(self, sensor):   self.sensor = sensor
    
    def motion_detected(self):
        print("Mediator: motion → turning lights on")
        self.lights.turn_on()

class MotionSensor:
    def __init__(self, mediator):
        self.mediator = mediator
    def detect(self):
        print("Sensor: someone is here!")
        self.mediator.motion_detected()

class Lights:
    def __init__(self, mediator):
        self.mediator = mediator
    def turn_on(self):
        print("Lights: ON")

# Setup
home = HomeMediator()
lights = Lights(home)
sensor = MotionSensor(home)
home.register_lights(lights)
home.register_sensor(sensor)

sensor.detect()   # clean, no direct coupling
```

### Usage
- Chat rooms  
- Air-traffic control systems  
- Complex dashboards with many widgets

## Memento

### Problem  
You need to save an object’s state so you can restore it later (undo, checkpoint, crash recovery) without exposing its private data.  
> Example: a configuration tool lets the user try new settings — they must be able to press “cancel” and get the original values back.

### Solution  
Ask the object to create a small “memento” token containing its state. Store the token. Later, give the token back to restore.

```python
class DeviceConfig:
    def __init__(self):
        self.baudrate = 9600
        self.parity = "Even"
    
    def create_memento(self):
        return {"baudrate": self.baudrate, "parity": self.parity}
    
    def restore(self, memento):
        self.baudrate = memento["baudrate"]
        self.parity = memento["parity"]

class ConfigEditor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.backup = None
    
    def start_editing(self):
        self.backup = self.config.create_memento()
    
    def cancel(self):
        if self.backup:
            self.config.restore(self.backup)

# Usage
cfg = DeviceConfig()
editor = ConfigEditor(cfg)

editor.start_editing()
cfg.baudrate = 115200
cfg.parity = "None"
print(cfg.baudrate)   # 115200

editor.cancel()
print(cfg.baudrate)   # 9600 — back to original
```

### Usage
- Undo in editors  
- Game save/restore  
- Configuration rollback

## Visitor

### Problem  
You need to add new operations to a group of existing classes without changing them (e.g. export to JSON, calculate size, print debug).  
> Example: you have many sensor classes — later you want to add “convert to CSV” without touching every sensor class.

### Solution  
Create a visitor object that carries the new operation. Each existing class accepts the visitor and calls the right method on it.

```python
class Sensor:
    def accept(self, visitor): ...

class TemperatureSensor(Sensor):
    def __init__(self, value): self.value = value
    def accept(self, visitor): return visitor.visit_temp(self)

class PressureSensor(Sensor):
    def __init__(self, value): self.value = value
    def accept(self, visitor): return visitor.visit_pressure(self)

class CsvVisitor:
    def visit_temp(self, sensor):
        return f"temp,{sensor.value}"
    def visit_pressure(self, sensor):
        return f"pressure,{sensor.value}"

# Usage — new operation without changing sensor classes
sensors = [TemperatureSensor(25.4), PressureSensor(1013)]
visitor = CsvVisitor()

for s in sensors:
    print(s.accept(visitor))
# temp,25.4
# pressure,1013
```

### Usage (rare but powerful)
- Adding export formats  
- AST traversals in compilers  
- Reporting on complex object trees
