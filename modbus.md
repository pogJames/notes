**Modbus** is a simple, widely-used **industrial communication protocol** that allows electronic devices to talk to each other—typically in automation and control systems.

Here’s the idea in plain language:

### **What it does**

* Lets a **master** device (like a PLC, SCADA system, or computer) request data from **slave** devices (like sensors, meters, or controllers).
* Transfers data such as temperatures, voltages, switch states, or commands.

### **Where it’s used**

* Factories and industrial equipment
* Power systems (meters, relays)
* Building automation (HVAC, lighting controllers)

### **How it communicates**

Modbus comes in several variants:

* **Modbus RTU** – runs over RS-485/RS-232 serial lines; very common in field devices.
* **Modbus ASCII** – older, text-based version over serial lines.
* **Modbus TCP** – runs over Ethernet networks.

### **Why it’s popular**

* Open and free to use
* Simple structure
* Works on very low-cost hardware
* Compatible across many manufacturers

If you want, I can explain how Modbus messages are structured, how addressing works, or how to implement a client/server.
